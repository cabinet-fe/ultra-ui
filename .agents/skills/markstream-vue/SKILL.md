description: Integrate markstream-vue into a Vue 3 app. Use when Codex needs to add the Vue 3 renderer, import CSS in the right order, choose renderer, DOM, and code-block modes, choose between `content` and `nodes`, coordinate long AI timelines with `MarkstreamVirtualTimeline`, `useMarkstreamVirtualAdapter`, or `vue-virtual-scroller`, enable optional peers such as stream-diffs, stream-markdown, Mermaid, KaTeX, D2, or Infographic, or wire scoped custom components in a non-Nuxt Vue repository.

# Markstream Vue 3

Use this skill when the host app is plain Vue 3, typically Vite-based, and not Nuxt.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the repo is Vue 3 and not Nuxt.
2. Install `markstream-vue` plus only the optional peers required by the requested features.
3. Import `markstream-vue/index.css` after resets.
   - In Tailwind or UnoCSS projects, use `@import 'markstream-vue/index.css' layer(components);`.
   - The root JS import does not inject styles; use `markstream-vue/index.css` or `markstream-vue/index.px.css` explicitly.
4. Start with `content` and choose the renderer mode by surface.
   - Use `mode="chat"` for AI chat or SSE output. It uses lightweight batches, `<pre>` code rendering by default, `fade=false`, and `max-live-nodes=0`; `smooth-streaming="auto"` paces visible output.
   - Use `mode="docs"` for rich document surfaces. It is the default, enables larger batches, tooltips, fade, and enhanced `stream-diffs` code blocks when the peer is installed.
   - Use `mode="minimal"` when the surface is lightweight but not chat.
   - Choose regular fenced-code rendering with `code-renderer="monaco" | "shiki" | "pre"`. The compatibility-named `monaco` mode loads `stream-diffs`; `shiki` uses `stream-markdown`; `pre` needs no code peer. `render-code-blocks-as-pre=true` takes precedence.
   - Use `dom-mode="minimal"` only when the surface can also disable wrapper-dependent features such as fade, batching, deferral, virtualization, typewriter, and custom components; otherwise it falls back to full DOM.
   - `typewriter` only controls the blinking cursor and defaults to `false`. Prefer `typewriter="simple"` for high-frequency chat and precise mode for complex inline cursor placement.
   - Set `:smooth-streaming="false"` to preserve raw chunk cadence; set `:smooth-streaming="true"` to force smooth pacing even on first-screen content (may cause hydration mismatch in SSR).
   - When overriding mode defaults on a high-frequency stream, pair smooth streaming with `:fade="false"` to avoid delta fade (280 ms) stacking with high-commit pacing.
   - **Streaming vs recovering history**: in chat UIs the same `MarkdownRender` starts streaming and later switches to history when `final=true`.
     - Streaming: `mode="chat"`, `smooth-streaming="auto"`, `:fade="false"`, `typewriter=true`.
     - Recovering/completed chat history: keep `mode="chat"` on the same chat row to avoid switching code renderer or layout strategy when `final=true`; use `:smooth-streaming="false"`, `typewriter=false`, and only set `:fade="true"` when the host explicitly wants a history-entry animation.
     - Use `mode="minimal"` for lightweight non-chat recovered content, and use `mode="docs"` only for rich document surfaces, not for finalizing an existing chat message.
   - Switch to `nodes` plus `final` only when the app needs custom AST control, worker preparsing, or structural updates beyond pacing.
   - Remember that `html-policy` now defaults to `safe`, and Mermaid strict mode is on by default through `mermaid-props`.
5. For long AI transcripts or existing message virtualizers, choose the virtual-scroll path.
   - Prefer `MarkstreamVirtualTimeline` when the app does not already own timeline virtualization.
   - If the app already uses `vue-virtual-scroller` `DynamicScroller`, use `useMarkstreamVirtualAdapter()` and bind `adapter.markdownProps(item, index)` to Markdown items.
   - Put `adapter.measureItem(item, index, el)` on the outer timeline row so row chrome is included in item height.
   - Use Markstream's reported logical height (`metrics.totalHeight` through the adapter/virtualizer), not the renderer element's current `offsetHeight`, because Markdown node virtualization may only mount the live window.
   - On thread switches, save `adapter.captureThreadState()` together with the scroller cache; restore the scroller cache before restoring the Markstream anchor.
6. Use `custom-id` plus scoped `setCustomComponents(...)` for local overrides, or import `{ VueRendererMarkdown }` from `markstream-vue` and install it when the repo already has an app-level plugin entry.
7. Validate with the smallest useful dev, build, or typecheck command.

## Default Decisions

- Vue 3 apps default to `content`; choose `mode` before fine-tuning lower-level render props.
- Omit `mode` only when the surface should use rich docs defaults.
- Smooth streaming (`smooth-streaming="auto"`) is on by default when `typewriter` or `max-live-nodes <= 0`. It only paces the `content` path; `nodes` mode is never affected.
- For manual pacing with `nodes`, use `useSmoothMarkdownStream` directly: `enqueue()` chunks, `finish()` when done, render from `visible`, and wait for `caughtUp` before final parsing.
- Streaming vs recovering history: keep the same renderer mode for a given chat row; when `final=true`, disable smooth streaming/typewriter and optionally enable fade. Switch to `mode="docs"` only when moving content into a separate rich document surface. See `docs/guide/ai-chat-streaming.md` for full examples.
- Prefer local component registration unless the repo already uses a shared plugin entry.
- If a Vue 3 app already virtualizes messages, keep that outer virtualizer in charge and enable `virtual-scroll` only on large Markdown messages.
- For `vue-virtual-scroller`, keep `sessionKey` tied to content identity (`thread:item:revision`) and `measurementKey` tied to layout identity such as width, theme, font, and density.
- When enhanced code blocks need app-level preloading, import `preloadCodeBlockRuntime` from `markstream-vue`. Existing `getUseMonaco()` calls remain compatible despite the historical name.
- Despite the retained `monaco` API names, the Vue 3 enhanced code surface uses `stream-diffs`; do not install `stream-monaco` unless the host directly consumes that package for another reason.
- Keep `html-policy="safe"` and Mermaid strict mode unless the task is explicitly preserving trusted legacy behavior.
- If a trusted surface needs pre-hardening behavior, opt out locally with `html-policy="trusted"` and `:mermaid-props="{ isStrict: false }"`, and call out the trust boundary in the final handoff.
- If the host is actually Nuxt, leave SSR-specific setup to `markstream-nuxt`.
